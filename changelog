  * Provide predefined dh_params (via 'turnkey-make-ssl-cert' where relevant)
    as per RFC7919 - part of #1653.

    custom fastcgi service and setup).

  * Enable HSTS by default (only effects HTTPS traffic - full implementation
    also requires HTTP redirect to HTTPS and valid cert).

  * Updated version of mysqltuner script.

  * Reorgnaise/refactor build code so there is now a dedicated
    lighttpd-php-mysql.mk and plan files. Generic/shared Lighttpd related
    build code now resides in common. (Development - should have no end user
    impact).
